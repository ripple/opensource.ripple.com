# simulate
<!-->Add link to github source after feature is merged into devnet.<-->
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/pull/5069 "Source")

{% partial file="/snippets/_simulate-disclaimer.md" /%}

The `simulate` method executes a dry run of _any_ transaction type, enabling you to preview the results and metadata of a transaction without committing them to the XRP Ledger. Since this command never submits a transaction to the network, it doesn't incur any fees.

{% admonition type="warning" name="Warning" %}

The `simulate` method isn't guaranteed to be the same when you actually submit a transaction because the ledger state--which affects how a transaction is processed--can change between the transaction simulation and submission.

The request includes the following parameters:

| Field     | Type    | Required | Description |
| --------- | ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `tx_blob` | String  | Yes      | The transaction to simulate, in [binary format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/binary-format). If you include this field, do not also include `tx_json`.      |
| `tx_json` | Object  | Yes      | The transaction to simulate, in JSON format. If you include this field, do not also include `tx_blob`.                                                                   |
| `binary`  | Boolean | No       | The default value is `false`, which returns data and metadata in JSON format. If `true`, returns data and metadata in binary format, serialized to a hexadecimal string. |

{% admonition type="info" name="Transaction Notes" %}

- The simulated transaction must be unsigned.
- If the `SigningPubKey` field is included in the transaction, it will be verified.
- If `Fee`, `Sequence`, or `SigningPubKey` fields aren't included in the transaction, the server automatically fills in a value that will be present in the response.

The response follows the [standard format](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/api-conventions/response-formatting), with a successful result containing the following fields:

| Field          | Type   | Description |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `tx_json`      | Object | The transaction that was simulated, including auto-filled values. Included if `binary` was `false`. |
| `tx_blob`      | String | The serialized transaction that was simulated, including auto-filled values. Included if `binary` was `true`. |
| `ledger_index` | [Ledger Index](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#ledger-index) | The ledger index of the ledger that would have included this transaction. |
| `meta`         | Object | Transaction metadata, which describes the results of the transaction. Not included if the transaction fails with a code that means it wouldn’t be included in the ledger (such as a non-TEC code). Included if `binary` was `false`. |
| `meta_blob`    | String | Transaction metadata, which describes the results of the transaction. Not included if the transaction fails with a code that means it wouldn’t be included in the ledger (such as a non-TEC code). Included if `binary` was `true`. |


## Possible Errors

The RPC will error if:

- Both (or neither) `tx_json` and `tx_blob` are included in the request.
- Any of the fields are of an incorrect type.
- The transaction is signed.
