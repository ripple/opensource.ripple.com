# Create a Bridge

{% partial file="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" /%}

The `bridge create` command enables you to set up a bridge.


## Create a Config File

Create a JSON config file in this format:

```json
{
    "lockingChain": {
        "type": "evm",
        "url": "https://rpc-evm-sidechain.peersyst.tech",
        "fundingPrivateKey": "****",
        "witnesses": [
            "0x96329A50d10a3F69311E4f4E108672926c51c474"
        ],
        "tokenCode": "USD",
        "tokenAddress": "0x92AE4ba2305F6c64E9715b60CF774784079C463B"
    },
    "issuingChain": {
        "type": "xrp",
        "url": "wss://sidechain-net1.devnet.rippletest.net",
        "fundingPrivateKey": "****",
        "witnesses": [
            "rpSspP5yYyomcSrgsohyKMCnu5oJsTMkYP"
        ]
    },
    "threshold": 1,
    "minRewardAmount": 1,
    "minCreateAmount": 20
}
```
