<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

The bridge client provides a user interface to interact with your bridge. You can use the client to connect wallets and transfer XRP or tokens across XRPL chains.

Running a bridge client requires you to:

1. [Configure the client](configure-the-bridge-client.md).
2. [Start the bridge client](start-the-bridge-client.md).
