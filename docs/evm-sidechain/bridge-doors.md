# Bridge Doors

<embed src="/snippets/_evm-sidechain-disclaimer.md" />

Bridge doors on the XRPL EVM sidechain are _Solidity_ smart contracts that have the logic to execute all transactions introduced by XLS-38d.

The bridge doors don't hold any assets, instead sending them to a Gnosis Safe multisig account.

Bridge doors require permissions to execute safe transactions, unlocking assets when enough attestations are received for an event. As such, there is a close relationship between a bridge door and Gnosis Safe. If at any time the bridge governers want to pause or deactivate the bridge, they can disable the bridge's permissions to execute any more operations.
