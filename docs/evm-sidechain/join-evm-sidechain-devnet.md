# Join the XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain Devnet

This tutorial walks you through the steps to join the existing **XRP Ledger EVM Sidechain Devnet**.

For ease of use, create an alias, `exprd`, to run all commands inside your Docker container.

## Hardware requirements

This are the hardware requirements needed for running an EVM Sidechain node:

* Operating system: `linux/amd64`
* 4 or more physical CPU cores
* At least 500GB of NVME SSD disk storage. Hard drive I/O speed is crucial!
* At least 32GB of memory (RAM)
* At least 100mbps network bandwidth

## Pre-requisites

Before proceeding to initialize the node, ensure that the following pre-requisites are installed and running:

* Docker 19+
*   Create an alias to run all commands in this tutorial inside a Docker container:

    ```bash
    alias exrpd="docker run -it --rm -v ~/.exrpd:/root/.exrpd peersyst/xrp-evm-blockchain:latest exrpd"
    ```

## Initialize Node

The first task is to initialize the node, which creates the necessary validator and node configuration files.

1.  Initialize the chain parameters using the following command:

    ```bash
    exrpd config chain-id exrp_1440002-1
    ```
2.  Create or add a key to your node. For this tutorial, we use the `test` keyring:

    ```bash
    exrpd keys add <key_name> --keyring-backend test
    ```

    Note the `key_name` you enter as you need to reference it in subsequent steps.

    **Note** For more information on a more secure setup for your validator, refer to [cosmos-sdk keys and keyrings](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/run-node/keyring.html) and [validator security](evm-sidechain-validator-security.md).
3.  Initialize the node using the following command:

    ```bash
    exrpd init <your_custom_moniker> --chain-id exrp_1440002-1
    ```

    Monikers can contain only ASCII characters. Using Unicode characters renders your node unreachable.

All these commands create your `~/.exrpd` (i.e `$HOME`) directory with subfolders `config/` and `data/`. In the `config` directory, the most important files for configuration are `app.toml` and `config.toml`.

## Genesis & Seeds

1.  Copy the Genesis File.

    Download the `genesis.json` file from here and copy it to the `config` directory: `~/.exrpd/config/genesis.json`. This is a genesis file with the chain-id and genesis accounts balances.

    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Peersyst/xrp-evm-archive/main/poa-devnet/genesis.json ~/.exrpd/config/
    ```

    Verify the genesis configuration file:

    ```bash
    exrpd validate-genesis
    ```
2.  Add Persistent Peer Nodes

    Set the [`persistent_peer`](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/tendermint-core/using-tendermint.html#persistent-peer)s field in `~/.exrpd/config/config.toml` to specify peers with which your node maintains persistent connections. You can retrieve them from the list of available peers on the archive repo ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Peersyst/xrp-evm-archive/main/devnet/peers.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Peersyst/xrp-evm-archive/main/devnet/peers.txt)).

    To get a list of entries from the `peers.txt` file in the `PEERS` variable, run the following command:

    ```bash
    PEERS=`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Peersyst/xrp-evm-archive/main/poa-devnet/peers.txt | sort -R | head -n 10 | awk '{print $1}' | paste -s -d, -`
    ```

    Use `sed` to include them in the configuration. You can also add them manually:

    ```bash
    sed -i.bak -e "s/^persistent_peers *=.*/persistent_peers = \"$PEERS\"/" ~/.exrpd/config/config.toml
    ```

## Start a Node

1.  Start a node container.

    ```bash
    exrpd start
    ```
2.  Provide Peersyst ([acarrera@peersyst.com](mailto:acarrera@peersyst.com)) with the key from this command:

    ```bash
    exrpd keys show <key_name> --keyring-backend=<keyring>
    ```

    **Note:** Peersyst provides your node with proof of authority to validate blocks on Devnet. This process takes 2-3 days.

## Run a Devnet Validator Node

**Warning:** Before creating a Devnet validator node, ensure that:

* Peersyst provides your node with proof of authority.
* You're running the node container.

Create a Devnet validator node with this command:

```bash
exrpd tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=1000000axrp \
  --pubkey=$(exrpd tendermint show-validator) \
  --moniker="<your_custom_moniker>" \
  --chain-id=<chain_id> \
  --commission-rate="0.05" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="1000000" \
  --gas="auto" \
  --gas-prices="0.025axrp" \
  --from=<key_name>
```

**Notes:**

*   If you used a different keyring backend from the default `os`, you need to include this option:

    ```bash
    --keyring-backend=<keyring>
    ```
* When specifying commission parameters, the `commission-max-change-rate` is used to measure % _point_ change over the `commission-rate`. For example, 1% to 2% is a 100% rate increase, but only 1 percentage point.
* `Min-self-delegation` is a strictly positive integer that represents the minimum amount of self-delegated voting power your validator must always have. A `min-self-delegation` of `1000000` means your validator will never have a self-delegation lower than `1 axrp`.

Once enough voting power (+2/3) from the genesis validators is up-and-running, the node starts producing blocks.
