| `Asset2`         | Object              | STIssue           | Yes       | The definition for the other asset this AMM holds. In JSON, this is an object with `currency` and `issuer` fields. |
| `AMMAccount`     | String              | AccountID         | Yes       | The address of the [special account](https://xrpl.org/accountroot.html#special-amm-accountroot-objects) that holds this AMM's assets. |

The holders of these tokens can vote on the AMM's trading fee in proportion to their holdings, or redeem the tokens for a share of the AMM's assets which grows with the trading fees collected. |
| `TradingFee`     | Number              | UInt16            | Yes       | The percentage fee to be charged for trades against this AMM instance, in units of 1/100,000. The maximum value is 1000, for a 1% fee. |
| `VoteSlots`      | Array               | STArray           | No        | A list of vote objects, representing votes on the pool's trading fee. |

### Auction Slot Object

The `AuctionSlot` field contains an object with the following nested fields:

| Field           | JSON Type           | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |

## AMM Flags

There are currently no flags defined for `AMM` objects.

## AMM ID Format

The ID of an `AMM` object is the [SHA-512Half][] of the following values, concatenated in order:

1. The `AMM` space key (`0x0041`)
0. The AccountID of the first asset's issuer.
0. The 160-bit currency code of the first token.
