# Deposit and Withdraw First-Loss Capital

This tutorial shows you how to deposit and withdraw first-loss capital from a [LoanBroker](../reference/ledger-data/loanbroker.md) on the XRP Ledger. First-loss capital helps protect vault depositor's assets, acting as a buffer in the event of loan defaults.

The tutorial demonstrates how a loan broker can manage risk by depositing XRP as first-loss capital, and how they can withdraw it when needed.

_(Requires the [Lending Protocol amendment][] {% not-enabled /%})_

## Goals

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Deposit an MPT as first-loss capital into a `LoanBroker` entry.
- Check the available cover balance in the loan broker's pseudo-account.
- Withdraw first-loss capital from a `LoanBroker` entry.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you should:

- Have a basic understanding of the XRP Ledger.
- Have an XRP Ledger client library set up in your development environment. This page provides examples for the following:
  - **JavaScript** with the [xrpl.js library](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl.js). See [Get Started Using JavaScript](https://xrpl.org/docs/tutorials/javascript/build-apps/get-started?__step=install-node-tag) for setup steps.

## Source Code

You can find the complete source code for this tutorial's examples in the [code samples section of this website's repository](https://github.com/ripple/opensource.ripple.com/tree/main/_code-samples/lending-protocol/).

## Steps

### 1. Install dependencies

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="JavaScript" %}
From the code sample folder, use npm to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install xrpl
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

### 2. Set up client and accounts

To get started, import the necessary libraries and instantiate a client to connect to the XRPL. This example imports:
- `xrpl`: Used for XRPL client connection and transaction handling.
- `fs` and `child_process`: Used to run tutorial set up scripts.

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="JavaScript" %}
{% code-snippet file="/_code-samples/lending-protocol/js/coverDepositAndWithdraw.js" language="js" before="// This step checks" /%}
{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

Next, load the loan broker account, loan broker ID, and MPT issuance ID.

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="JavaScript" %}
{% code-snippet file="/_code-samples/lending-protocol/js/coverDepositAndWithdraw.js" language="js" from="// This step checks" before="// Prepare LoanBrokerCoverDeposit" /%}
{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

This example uses preconfigured accounts and loan broker data from the `lendingSetup.js` script, but you can replace `loanBroker`, `loanBrokerID`, and `mptID` with your own values.

### 3. Prepare LoanBrokerCoverDeposit transaction

Create the [LoanBrokerCoverDeposit transaction](../reference/transactions/loanbrokercoverdeposit.md) object:

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="JavaScript" %}
{% code-snippet file="/_code-samples/lending-protocol/js/coverDepositAndWithdraw.js" language="js" from="// Prepare LoanBrokerCoverDeposit" before="// Sign, submit, and wait for deposit" /%}
{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

The `Amount` field specifies the MPT and amount to deposit as first-loss capital. If the transaction succeeds, the amount is deposited and held in the pseudo-account associated with the `LoanBroker` entry.

### 4. Submit LoanBrokerCoverDeposit transaction

Sign and submit the `LoanBrokerCoverDeposit` transaction to the XRP Ledger.

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="JavaScript" %}
{% code-snippet file="/_code-samples/lending-protocol/js/coverDepositAndWithdraw.js" language="js" from="// Sign, submit, and wait for deposit" before="// Extract cover balance" /%}
{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

Verify that the transaction succeeded by checking for a `tesSUCCESS` result code.

### 5. Check cover balance after deposit

Retrieve the cover balance from the transaction result by checking the `LoanBroker` entry in the transaction metadata.

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="JavaScript" %}
{% code-snippet file="/_code-samples/lending-protocol/js/coverDepositAndWithdraw.js" language="js" from="// Extract cover balance" before="// Prepare LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw" /%}
{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

The `LoanBroker` pseudo-account address is the `Account` field, and `CoverAvailable` shows the cover balance.

### 6. Prepare LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw transaction

Create the [LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw transaction](../reference/transactions/loanbrokercoverwithdraw.md) object:

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="JavaScript" %}
{% code-snippet file="/_code-samples/lending-protocol/js/coverDepositAndWithdraw.js" language="js" from="// Prepare LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw" before="// Sign, submit, and wait for withdraw" /%}
{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

### 7. Submit LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw transaction

Sign and submit the `LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw` transaction to the XRP Ledger.

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="JavaScript" %}
{% code-snippet file="/_code-samples/lending-protocol/js/coverDepositAndWithdraw.js" language="js" from="// Sign, submit, and wait for withdraw" before="// Extract updated cover balance" /%}
{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

Verify that the transaction succeeded by checking for a `tesSUCCESS` result code.

### 8. Check cover balance after withdrawal

Retrieve the updated cover balance from the transaction result.

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="JavaScript" %}
{% code-snippet file="/_code-samples/lending-protocol/js/coverDepositAndWithdraw.js" language="js" from="// Extract updated cover balance" /%}
{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

The `CoverAvailable` field now shows the reduced balance after the withdrawal.
