# Loan

A `Loan` ledger entry defines the state of an on-chain loan agreement between a _Loan Broker_ and a _Borrower_. It contains all the details of the loan, such as fees and interest rates. You can create a `Loan` ledger entry with the [`LoanSet`](../transactions/loanset.md) transaction.

The `Loan` ledger entry is tracked in two [Owner Directories](https://xrpl.org/directorynode.html):
1. The owner directory of the _Borrower_ on the loan.
2. The owner directory of the `LoanBroker` pseudo-account.

_(Requires the [Lending Protocol amendment][] {% not-enabled /%})_

{% admonition type="info" name="Note" %}
When the loan broker discovers that the borrower can't make an upcoming payment, they can impair the loan to register a "paper loss" with the vault. The impairment mechanism moves up the `NextPaymentDueDate` to the time the loan is impaired, allowing the loan to default quicker. However, if the borrower makes a payment in the subsequent `GracePeriod`, the impairment status is removed.
