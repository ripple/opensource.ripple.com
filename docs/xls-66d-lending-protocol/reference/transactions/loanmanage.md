## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} Fields

In addition to the [common fields][], {% code-page-name /%} transactions use the following fields:

| Field Name     | JSON Type | Internal Type | Required? | Description |

| `LoanID`       | String    | Hash256      | Yes       | The ID of the `Loan` ledger entry to manage. |
| `Flags`        | String    | UInt32       | No        | The flag to modify the loan. |


## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} Flags

Transactions of the {% code-page-name /%} type support additional values in the [`flags` field], as follows:

| Field Name      | Hex Value    | Decimal Value | Description |
|:----------------|:-------------|:--------------|:------------|
| `tfLoanDefault` | `0x00010000` | `65536`       | Indicates the loan should be defaulted. |
| `tfLoanImpair`  | `0x00020000` | `131072`      | Indicates the the loan should be impaired. |
| `tfLoanUnimpair`| `0x00040000` | `262144`      | Indicates the the loan should be unimpaired. |


## Error Cases

Besides errors that can occur for all transactions, {% code-page-name /%} transactions can result in the following [transaction result codes][]:

| Error Code          | Description                        |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------|
| `temINVALID`        | the `LoanID` field is missing or set to zero. |
| `temINVALID_FLAG`   | Multiple management flags have been set. Only one can be set at a time. |
| `tecNO_ENTRY`       | The loan specified by `LoanID` doesn't exist. |
| `tecNO_PERMISSION`  | - The transaction is attempting to modify a defaulted loan, or a fully paid loan.<br>- The transaction is attempting to change the loan's impairment status to the one it already has. |
| `tecTOO_SOON`       | The loan can't be marked as defaulted before its payment due date and grace period have passed. |
| `tecLIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Marking the loan as impaired creates a loss greater than the vault's oustanding assets, which would put the vault in an invalid state. |
