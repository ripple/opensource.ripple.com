# LoanSet
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/develop/src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/LoanSet.cpp "Source")
{% raw-partial file="/docs/_snippets/_lending-sav-disclaimer.md" /%}

Creates a new `Loan` ledger entry, representing a loan agreement between a _Loan Broker_ and _Borrower_.

The `LoanSet` transaction is a mutual agreement between the _Loan Broker_ and _Borrower_, and must be signed by both parties. The following multi-signature flow can be initiated by either party:

1. The borrower or loan broker creates the transaction with the preagreed terms of the loan. They sign the transaction and set the `SigningPubKey`, `TxnSignature`, `Signers`, `Account`, `Fee`, `Sequence`, and `Counterparty` fields.
2. The counterparty verifies the loan terms and signature before signing and submitting the transaction.

_(Requires the [Lending Protocol amendment][] {% not-enabled /%})_

### CounterpartySignature Fields

An inner object that contains the signatures of the counterparty of the transaction. The object contains the following fields:

|:----------------|:----------|:--------------|:----------|:------------|
| `SigningPubKey` | String    | STBlob        | No        | The public key used to verify the validity of the signature. |

The final transaction must include either:
- Both the `SigningPubKey` and `TxnSignature` fields.
- The `Signers` field.

{% admonition type="info" name="Note" %}
This field isn't included in the `LoanSet` JSON, instead it's added to the stored transaction metadata after the counterparty submits the fully signed `LoanSet` transaction.

## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} Flags

Transactions of the {% code-page-name /%} type support additional values in the [`flags` field], as follows:

| `tfLoanOverpayment` | `0x00010000` | 65536 | Indicates that the loan supports overpayments. |


## Error Cases

Besides errors that can occur for all transactions, {% code-page-name /%} transactions can result in the following [transaction result codes][]:

| Error Code                | Description                        |
|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| `temBAD_SIGNER`           | - The transaction is missing a `CounterpartySignature` field.<br>- This transaction is part of a `Batch` transaction, but didn't specify a `Counterparty`. |
| `temINVALID`              | One or more of the numeric fields are outside their valid ranges. For example, the `GracePeriod` can't be longer than the `PaymentInterval`. |
| `tecNO_ENTRY`             | The `LoanBroker` doesn't exist. |
| `tecNO_PERMISSION`        | Neither the transaction sender's `Account` or the `Counterparty` field owns the associated `LoanBroker` ledger entry. |
| `tecINSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`   | - The `Vault` associated with the `LoanBroker` doesn't have enough assets to fund the loan.<br>- The `LoanBroker` ledger entry doesn't have enough first-loss capital to meet the minimum coverage requirement for the new total debt. |
| `tecLIMIT_EXCEEDED`       | The requested loan would cause the `LoanBroker` ledger entry to exceed it's maximum allowed debt. |
| `tecINSUFFICIENT_RESERVE` | The borrower's account doesn't have enough XRP to meet the reserve requirements. |
