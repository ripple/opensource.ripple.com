# LoanPay
[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/develop/src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/LoanPay.cpp "Source")
{% raw-partial file="/docs/_snippets/_lending-sav-disclaimer.md" /%}

Makes a payment on an active loan. Only the borrower on the loan can make payments, and payments must meet the minimum amount required for that period.

_(Requires the [Lending Protocol amendment][] {% not-enabled /%})_

A loan payment has four types, depending on the amount and timing of the payment:

- **Regular Payment**: A payment made on time, where the payment size and schedule are calculated with a standard [amortization formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_calculator).
- **Late Payment**: A payment made after the `NextPaymentDueDate` in the `Loan` ledger entry. Late payments include a `LatePaymentFee` and `LateInterestRate`.
- **Early Full Payment**: A payment that covers the outstanding principal of the loan. A `CloseInterestRate` is charged on the outstanding principal.
- **Overpayment**: A payment that exceeds the required minimum payment amount.

To see how loan payment transactions are calculated, see [transaction pseudo-code](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0066-lending-protocol#3244-transaction-pseudo-code).
