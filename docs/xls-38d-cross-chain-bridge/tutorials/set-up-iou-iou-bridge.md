# Set Up an IOU-IOU Bridge

{% partial file="/snippets/_xchain-bridges-disclaimer.md" /%}

## Prerequisites

- An XRP-XRP bridge must be set up between the locking and issuing chain.
- Ensure the witnesses' transaction submission accounts are funded on the locking and issuing chains.
- Door accounts exist for the bridge on the locking and issuing chains.


## Steps

1. Submit an `XChainCreateBridge` transaction from the door account on the locking chain.
  
    **Note:** Don't include a `MinAccountCreateAmount` value.

2. Submit a `SignerListSet` transaction from the door account on the locking chain, using the witnesses' signing keys as the signers.
   
3. Disable the master key on the locking chain's door account with an `AccountSet` transaction.
   
4. Submit an `XChainCreateBridge` transaction from the door account on the issuing chain.

5. Submit a `SignerListSet` transaction from the door account on the issuing chain, using the witnesses' signing keys as the signers.

6. Disable the master key on the issuing chain's door account with an `AccountSet` transaction.
