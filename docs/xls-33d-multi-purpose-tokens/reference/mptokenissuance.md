# MPTokenIssuance

The `MPTokenIssuance` object represents a single MPT issuance and holds data associated with the issuance itself. Token issuances are created using the `MPTokenIssuanceCreate` transaction and can be destroyed by the `MPTokenIssuanceDestroy` transaction.

_(Added by the [MPTokenV1_1 amendment][].)_

## Example {{currentpage.name}} JSON

```json
{
    "LedgerEntryType": "MPTokenIssuance",
    "Flags": 131072,
    "Issuer": "rsA2LpzuawewSBQXkiju3YQTMzW13pAAdW",
    "AssetScale": "2",
    "MaximumAmount": "100000000",
    "OutstandingAmount": "5",
    "TransferFee": 50000,     
    "MPTokenMetadata": "",
    "OwnerNode": "74"
}
```

## MPTokenIssuanceID

The MPTokenIssuanceID is the result of SHA512-Half of the following values, concatenated in order:

- The MPTokenIssuance space key (0x007E).
- The AccountID of the issuer.
- The transaction sequence number.

## MPTokenIssuance Fields

MPToken objects have the following fields.

| Field Name        | JSON Type | Internal Type | Description |
|:------------------|:----------|:--------------|:------------|
| LedgerEntryType   | number    | UInt16        | The value 0x007E, mapped to the string MPTokenIssuance, indicates that this object describes a Multi-Purpose Token (MPT). |
| `Flags`             | number    | UInt32        | See [MPTokenIssuance Flags](#mptokenissuance-flags) |
| `Issuer`           | string    | AccountID     | The address of the account that controls both the issuance amounts and characteristics of a particular fungible token. |
| `AssetScale` | number    | UInt8       | An asset scale is the difference, in orders of magnitude, between a standard unit and a corresponding fractional unit. More formally, the asset scale is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, …) such that one standard unit equals 10^(-scale) of a corresponding fractional unit. If the fractional unit equals the standard unit, then the asset scale is 0. |
| `MaximumAmount`         | string    | UInt64        | This value is an unsigned number that specifies the maximum number of MPTs that can be distributed to non-issuing accounts (i.e., minted). For issuances that do not have a maximum limit, this value should be set to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. |
| `OutstandingAmount` | string    | UInt64        | Specifies the sum of all token amounts that have been minted to all token holders. This value can be stored on ledger as a default type so that when its value is 0, it takes up less space on ledger. This value is increased whenever an issuer pays MPTs to a non-issuer account, and decreased whenever a non-issuer pays MPTs into the issuing account. |
| `TransferFee`       | number    | UInt16        | This value specifies the fee, in tenths of a basis point, charged by the issuer for secondary sales of the token, if such sales are allowed at all. Valid values for this field are between 0 and 50,000 inclusive. A value of 1 is equivalent to 1/10 of a basis point or 0.001%, allowing transfer rates between 0% and 50%. A TransferFee of 50,000 corresponds to 50%. The default value for this field is 0. Any decimals in the transfer fee are rounded down. The fee can be rounded down to zero if the payment is small. Issuers should make sure that their MPT's AssetScale is large enough. |
| `PreviousTxnID`     | string    | Hash256       | Transaction ID of the transaction that most recently modified this object. |
| `PreviousTxnLgrSeq` | number    | UInt32        | The sequence of the ledger that contains the transaction that most recently modified this object. |
| `OwnerNode`         | number    | UInt64        | The page in the owner's directory where this item is referenced. |


### MPTokenIssuance Flags

Flags are properties or other options associated with the `MPToken` object.


| Flag Name           | Flag Value | Description                                     |
|:--------------------|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------|
| `lsfMPTLocked`      | `0x0001`   | If set, indicates that all balances are locked. |
| `lsfMPTAuthorized`  | `0x0002`   | If set, indicates that the issuer can lock an individual balance or all balances of this MPT. If not set, the MPT cannot be locked in any way.|
| `lsfMPTRequireAuth` | `0x0004`   | If set, indicates that individual holders must be authorized. This enables issuers to limit who can hold their assets. |
| `lsfMPTCanEscrow`   | `0x0008`   | If set, indicates that individual holders can place their balances into an escrow. |
| `lsfMPTCanTrade`    | `0x0010`   | If set, indicates that individual holders can trade their balances using the XRP Ledger DEX or AMM. |
| `lsfMPTCanTransfer` | `0x0020`   | If set, indicates that tokens held by non-issuers can be transferred to other accounts. If not set, indicates that tokens held by non-issuers cannot be transferred except back to the issuer; this enables use cases like store credit. |
| `lsfMPTCanClawback` | `0x0040`   | If set, indicates that the issuer may use the `Clawback` transaction to claw back value from individual holders. |

With the exception of `lsfMPTLocked`, which can be mutated via `MPTokenIssuanceSet` transactions, these flags are immutable: they can only be set during the `MPTokenIssuanceCreate` transaction and cannot be changed later.
