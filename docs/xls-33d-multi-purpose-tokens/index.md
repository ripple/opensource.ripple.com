# Multi-purpose Tokens

{% partial file="/snippets/_mpts-disclaimer.md" /%}

Multi-purpose tokens (MPTs) are a more compact and flexible type of fungible token.

Unlike trust lines, MPTs do not represent bidirectional debt relationships. Instead, MPTs function more like a unidirectional trust line with only one balance. This reduces the overhead to support common tokenization requirements, including non-monetary use cases such as tracking reputation points in an online game.
