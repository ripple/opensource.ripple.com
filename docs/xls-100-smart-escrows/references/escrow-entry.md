[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/a5d238e7d4fa6ef2b539b759d58744d0a1c33c0c/include/xrpl/protocol/detail/ledger_entries.macro#L329-L345 "Source")

An `Escrow` ledger entry represents an [escrow](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/payment-types/escrow), which holds funds until specific conditions are met. You can create an escrow by sending an [EscrowCreate transaction][].

## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} Fields

In addition to the [common fields](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/types/common-fields), {% code-page-name /%} entries have the following fields:

| Name                | JSON Type | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description            |
|:--------------------|:----------|:------------------|:----------|:-----------------------|
| `Account`           | String    | AccountID         | Yes       | The address of the owner (sender) of this escrow. This is the account that provided the funds, and gets it back if the escrow is canceled. |
| `Amount`            | Object or String    | Amount            | Yes       | The amount to be delivered by the payment in escrow. The amount can be XRP, or with the TokenEscrow amendment, a fungible token. {% amendment-disclaimer name="TokenEscrow" mode="updated" /%} |
| `Bytecode`          | String    | Blob              | No        | Compiled WebAssembly (WASM) code with a [Smart Escrow](../concepts/programmability.md) function that must return success for the escrow to finish. {% amendment-disclaimer name="SmartEscrow" /%} |
| `CancelAfter`       | Number    | UInt32            | No        | The escrow can be canceled if and only if this field is present _and_ the time it specifies has passed. Specifically, this is specified as [seconds since the Ripple Epoch][] and it "has passed" if it's earlier than the close time of the previous validated ledger. |
| `Condition`         | String    | Blob              | No        | A [PREIMAGE-SHA-256 crypto-condition](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-02#section-8.1), as hexadecimal. If present, the [EscrowFinish transaction][] must contain a fulfillment that satisfies this condition. |
| `Data`              | String    | Blob              | No        | Arbitrary data that can be read and written by this escrow's smart function. {% amendment-disclaimer name="SmartEscrow" /%} |
| `Destination`       | String    | AccountID         | Yes       | The destination address where the XRP is paid if the escrow is successful. |
| `DestinationNode`   | String    | UInt64            | No        | A hint indicating which page of the destination's owner directory links to this object, in case the directory consists of multiple pages. Omitted on escrows created before enabling the [fix1523 amendment][]. |
| `DestinationTag`    | Number    | UInt32            | No        | An arbitrary tag to further specify the destination for this escrow, such as a hosted recipient at the destination address. |
| `FinishAfter`       | Number    | UInt32            | No        | The time, in [seconds since the Ripple Epoch][], after which this escrow can be finished. Any [EscrowFinish transaction][] before this time fails. (Specifically, this is compared with the close time of the previous validated ledger.) |
| `OwnerNode`         | String    | UInt64            | Yes       | A hint indicating which page of the sender's owner directory links to this entry, in case the directory consists of multiple pages. |
| `PreviousTxnID`     | String    | UInt256           | Yes       | The identifying hash of the transaction that most recently modified this entry. |
| `PreviousTxnLgrSeq` | Number    | UInt32            | Yes       | The [index of the ledger][Ledger Index] that contains the transaction that most recently modified this entry. |
| `SourceTag`         | Number    | UInt32            | No        | An arbitrary tag to further specify the source for this escrow, such as a hosted recipient at the owner's address. |
| `TransferRate`      | Number    | UInt32            | No        | The transfer rate or fee to charge when users finish an escrow, locked at the creation of an escrow contract and used during settlement. Applicable to Trust Line Tokens and MPTs only. {% amendment-disclaimer name="TokenEscrow" /%} |
| `IssuerNode`        | Number    | UInt64            | No        | The ledger index of the issuer's directory node associated with the `Escrow`. Used when the issuer is neither the source nor destination account. {% amendment-disclaimer name="TokenEscrow" /%} |


## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} Flags

There are no flags defined for {% code-page-name /%} entries.


## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} Reserve

By default, {% code-page-name /%} entries count as one item towards the sender's owner reserve as long as the entry is in the ledger.

If the escrow has a `Bytecode` field that is more than 500 bytes, it counts as one item per 500 bytes, rounded up.

Finishing or canceling the escrow frees up the reserve.


## Escrow ID Format

The ID of an `Escrow` entry is the [SHA-512Half][] of the following values, concatenated in order:

* The Escrow space key (`0x0075`)
* The AccountID of the sender of the [EscrowCreate transaction][] that created the `Escrow` entry
* The Sequence number of the [EscrowCreate transaction][] that created the `Escrow` entry
    If the EscrowCreate transaction used a [Ticket](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/tickets), use the `TicketSequence` value instead.
