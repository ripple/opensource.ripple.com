# CredentialCreate Transaction

A CredentialCreate transaction creates a credential in the ledger. The issuer of the credential uses this transaction to provisionally issue a credential. The credential is not valid until the subject of the credential accepts it with a [CredentialAccept transaction][].

## Example CredentialCreate JSON

```json
{
    "TransactionType" : "CredentialCreate",
    "Account": "ra5nK24KXen9AHvsdFTKHSANinZseWnPcX",
    "Subject": "rsUiUMpnrgxQp24dJYZDhmV4bE3aBtQyt8",
    "CredentialType": "6D795F63726564656E7469616C",
    "Fee": "10",
    "Flags": 0,
    "Sequence": 234200
}
```


## CredentialCreate Fields

In addition to the [common fields][], CredentialCreate transactions use the following fields:

| Field            | JSON Type        | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Subject` | String - [Address][] | AccountID | Yes | The subject of the credential. |
| `CredentialType` | String - Hexadecimal | Blob | Yes | Arbitrary data defining the type of credential this entry represents. The minimum length is 1 byte and the maximum length is 64 bytes. |
| `Expiration` | Number | UInt32 | No | Time after which this credential should be considered expired, in [seconds since the Ripple Epoch][]. |
| `URI` | String | Blob | No | Arbitrary additional data about the credential, such as the URL where users can look up an associated Verifiable Credential document. If present, the minimum length is 1 byte and the maximum is 256 bytes. |

The `Account` field (the sender) of the transaction is the issuer of the credential. It is possible for the issuer and the subject to be the same account.

## Error Cases

Besides errors that can occur for all transactions, CredentialCreate transactions can result in the following [transaction result codes][]:

| Error Code | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| `tecDUPLICATE` | A credential with the same subject, issuer, and credential type already exists in the ledger. |
| `tecEXPIRED` | The credential's expiration time is in the past. |
| `tecNO_TARGET` | The account specified in the `Subject` field is not a funded account in the ledger. |
| `temDISABLED` | The related amendment is not enabled. |
| `temINVALID_ACCOUNT_ID` | The provided `Subject` field is invalid. For example, it contains [ACCOUNT_ZERO][]. |
