# CredentialAccept Transaction

A CredentialAccept transaction accepts a credential, which makes the credential valid. Only the subject of the credential can do this.

## Example CredentialAccept JSON

```json
{
    "TransactionType" : "CredentialAccept",
    "Account": "rsUiUMpnrgxQp24dJYZDhmV4bE3aBtQyt8",
    "Issuer": "ra5nK24KXen9AHvsdFTKHSANinZseWnPcX",
    "CredentialType": "6D795F63726564656E7469616C",
    "Fee": "10",
    "Flags": 0,
    "Sequence": 234203
}
```


## CredentialAccept Fields

In addition to the [common fields][], CredentialAccept transactions use the following fields:

| Field            | JSON Type        | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Issuer`         | String - [Address][] | AccountID     | Yes       | The address of the issuer that created the credential. |
| `CredentialType` | String           | Blob              | Yes       | Arbitrary data defining the type of credential. The minimum size is 1 byte and the maximum is 64 bytes. |

The `Account` field (the sender of this transaction) must be the subject of the credential.

The combination of `Account`, `Issuer`, and `CredentialType` must match a `Credential` ledger entry that exists in the ledger and has not already been accepted; otherwise, the transaction fails.

## Error Cases

| Error Code | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| `tecDUPLICATE` | The specified credential has already been accepted. |
| `tecEXPIRED` | The specified credential has an expiration time in the past. (In this case, the transaction also deletes the expired credentials from the ledger.) |
| `tecNO_ENTRY` | The credential uniquely identified by the `Account`, `Issuer`, and `CredentialType` fields of the transaction does not exist in the ledger. |
| `temDISABLED` | The related amendment is not enabled. |
| `temINVALID_ACCOUNT_ID` | The provided `Issuer` field is invalid. For example, it contains [ACCOUNT_ZERO][]. |
