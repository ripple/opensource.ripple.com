# CredentialDelete Transaction

A CredentialDelete transaction removes a credential from the ledger. In some cases, this can effectively revoke the credential. Users may also want to delete an unwanted credential to reduce their [reserve requirement][].

## Example CredentialDelete JSON

```json
{
    "TransactionType" : "CredentialDelete",
    "Account": "ra5nK24KXen9AHvsdFTKHSANinZseWnPcX",
    "Subject": "rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn",
    "CredentialType": "6D795F63726564656E7469616C",
    "Fee": "10",
    "Flags": 0,
    "Sequence": 234203
}
```


## CredentialDelete Fields

In addition to the [common fields][], CredentialDelete transactions use the following fields:

| Field            | JSON Type        | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `CredentialType` | String - Hexadecimal  | Blob | Yes | Arbitrary data defining the type of credential to delete. The minimum length is 1 byte and the maximum length is 256 bytes. |
| `Subject` | String - [Address][] | AccountID | No | The subject of the credential to delete. If omitted, use the `Account` (sender of the transaction) as the subject of the credential. |
| `Issuer` |  String - [Address][] | AccountID | No | The issuer of the credential to delete. If omitted, use the `Account` (sender of the transaction) as the issuer of the credential. |

You must provide the `Subject` field, `Issuer` field, or both.

This transaction looks for a [Credential ledger entry](./credential.md) with the specified subject, issuer, and credential type, and deletes that entry if the sender of the transaction has permission to. The holder or issuer of a credential can delete it at any time. If the credential is expired, anyone can delete it.


## Error Cases

| Error Code | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| `temDISABLED` | The related amendment is not enabled. |
| `temINVALID_ACCOUNT_ID` | A provided `Subject` or `Issuer` field is invalid. For example, it contains [ACCOUNT_ZERO][]. |
| `tecNO_PERMISSION` | The sender is neither the issuer nor subject of the credential, and the credential is not expired. |
| `tecNO_ENTRY` | The specified credential does not exist in the ledger. |
