# DepositPreauth Transaction

A DepositPreauth transaction grants preauthorization to deliver payments to your account. This is only useful if you are using (or plan to use) [Deposit Authorization](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/depositauth).

{% admonition type="success" name="Tip" %}
You can use this transaction before you enable Deposit Authorization. This may be useful to ensure a smooth transition from not requiring deposit authorization to requiring it.

## DepositPreauth Fields

In addition to the [common fields][], DepositPreauth transactions use the following fields:

| Field                    | JSON Type            | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:-------------------------|:---------------------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Authorize`              | String - [Address][] | AccountID         | No        | An account to preauthorize. |
| `AuthorizeCredentials`   | Array                | STArray           | No        | A set of credentials to authorize. |
| `Unauthorize`            | String               | AccountID         | No        | An account whose preauthorization should be revoked. |
| `UnauthorizeCredentials` | Array                | STArray           | No        | A set of credentials whose preauthorization should be revoked. |

You must provide **exactly one** of `Authorize`, `AuthorizeCredentials`, `Unauthorize`, or `UnauthorizeCredentials`.

If this transaction is successful, it creates or removes a [DepositPreauth entry](./depositpreauth-entry.md) in the ledger, based on the field provided.


### AuthorizeCredentials Objects

If provided, each member of the `AuthorizeCredentials` field or `UnauthorizeCredentials` field must be an inner object with the following fields:

| Field            | JSON Type            | [Internal Type][] | Required? | Description |
|:-----------------|:---------------------|:------------------|:----------|:------------|
| `Issuer`         | String - [Address][] | AccountID         | Yes       | The issuer of the credential. |
| `CredentialType` | String - Hexadecimal | Blob              | Yes       | The credential type of the credential. |

## Error Cases

In addition to error types that can occur for all transactions, DepositPreauth transactions can result in the following error codes:

| Error Code                | Description |
|:--------------------------|:------------|
| `tecDUPLICATE`            | The transaction would create a preauthorization that already exists. |
| `tecINSUFFICIENT_RESERVE` | The sender would not meet the [reserve requirement][] after adding another entry to the ledger. (A DepositPreauth entry counts as one item towards the authorizer's owner reserve.) |
| `tecNO_ENTRY`             | The transaction tried to revoke a preauthorization that does not exist in the ledger. |
| `tecNO_ISSUER`            | One or more specified credential issuers does not exist in the ledger. |
| `tecNO_TARGET`            | The transaction tried to authorize an account that is not a funded account in the ledger. |
| `temCANNOT_PREAUTH_SELF`  | The address in the `Authorize` field is the sender of the transaction. You cannot preauthorize yourself. |
| `temDISABLED`             | A required amendment is not enabled. |
