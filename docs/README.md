# Open Source Projects

Ripple contributes to the maintenance and development of the open source XRP Ledger. The XRP Ledger is a decentralized public blockchain and Ripple collaborates with the wider XRP Ledger community to develop new features and capabilities for the XRP Ledger.

This site provides information on open source projects that Ripple engineers are working on, including in-progress documentation for features that are in development. 

While Ripple may be the primary developer on these open source projects, it is not a centralized authority (there isn't one) and  there is no central actor. Community contributions and feedback are welcome!

Proposals for new features and amendments go through the consensus process for review and approval by the XRP Ledger community before they can be merge into the XRP Ledger code base. Once a feature is merged on the `master` branch of the `rippled` codebase, documentation for that feature will be available on [xrpl.org](https://xrpl.org).

To learn more about the consensus process and the workflow for features to go from an idea to activation on the XRP Ledger, see <https://xrpl.org/amendments.html>.
