# VaultDelete

[[Source]](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/master/src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/VaultDelete.cpp "Source")
{% raw-partial file="/docs/_snippets/_lending-sav-disclaimer.md" /%}

Permanently deletes an existing `Vault` object from the ledger, removes all associated ledger entries, and returns the owner reserve to the Vault Owner.

Only the Vault Owner can initiate this transaction, and the vault must be completely empty before deletion.

_(Requires the [Single Asset Vault amendment][] {% not-enabled /%})_

## Error Cases

Besides errors that can occur for all transactions, VaultCreate transactions can result in the following [transaction result codes](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/transactions/transaction-results):

| Error Code                | Description                        |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------|
| `tecNO_ENTRY`             | The `Vault` object with the provided `VaultID` does not exist on the ledger. |
| `tecNO_PERMISSION`        | The account submitting the transaction is not the `Owner` of the vault. |
| `tecHAS_OBLIGATIONS`      | The vault to be deleted is connected to objects that cannot be deleted in the ledger. For example, the owner directory of the vault's pseudo-account contains references to any objects other than the vault, shares, or assets. |
