# Vault

[[Source]](https://github.com/Bronek/rippled/blob/vault/include/xrpl/protocol/detail/ledger_entries.macro#L465-L486 "Source")

A {% code-page-name /%} object defines the state of a tokenized vault. It contains key details such as available assets, shares, total value, and other relevant information. You can create a {% code-page-name /%} object with the [VaultCreate](./transactions/vault-create.md)  transaction.

The {% code-page-name /%} object is tracked in an [Owner Directory](https://xrpl.org/directorynode.html) owned by the Vault Owner account.
Additionally, to facilitate `Vault` object lookup, the object is tracked in the `OwnerDirectory` of the vault's `pseudo-account`.

_(Requires the [Single Asset Vault amendment][] {% not-enabled /%})_

## {% $frontmatter.seo.title %} Flags

{% code-page-name /%}  entries can have the followings flags:

| Flag Name         | Flag Value   | Description                 |
| :---------------- | :----------- | :---------------------------|

## Vault ID Format

The ID of a {% code-page-name /%} entry is the [`SHA512-Half`](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/data-types/basic-data-types#hashes) of the following values, concatenated in order:

- The {% code-page-name /%} space key `0x0056` (capital V).
- The [AccountID](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/protocol/binary-format/#accountid-fields) of the account submitting the `VaultSet` transaction (i.e., `VaultOwner`).
- The transaction `Sequence` number. If the transaction used a [Ticket](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/accounts/tickets), use the `TicketSequence` value.
