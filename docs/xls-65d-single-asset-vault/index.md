# Single Asset Vault

A single asset vault is an XRP Ledger primitive that aggregates assets from multiple depositors and makes them available to other on-chain protocols, such as the Lending Protocol (currently in development). A vault asset can be [XRP](https://xrpl.org/docs/introduction/what-is-xrp), a [Fungible Token](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens), or an [MPT (Multi-Purpose Token)](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts/tokens/fungible-tokens/multi-purpose-tokens).
