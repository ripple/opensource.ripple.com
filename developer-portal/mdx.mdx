# Using MDX

Use MDX by naming the file extension as `.mdx` and importing the components at the top of the file.

You can import a single extension:

```jsx
import { OpenApiResponse } from '@redocly/developer-portal/ui';
```

Or multiple extensions at the same time:

```jsx
import {
  Box,
  Button,
  FlexSection,
  Flex,
  Jumbotron,
  H1,
  H2,
  Link,
  ThinTile,
  WideTile,
  Emphasis,
  SectionHeader,
} from '@redocly/developer-portal/ui';
```

We created a library (`@redocly/developer-portal/ui`) with components you can reference.

Try and create an MDX file which renders one of your API's response objects.

With Samples Panel:

```jsx
<OpenApiResponse definitionId="petstore" pointer="#/components/responses/PetResponse" />
```

<OpenApiResponse definitionId="petstore" pointer="#/components/responses/PetResponse" />

Without Samples Panel:

```jsx
<OpenApiResponse
  definitionId="petstore"
  pointer="#/components/responses/PetResponse"
  hideSamples={true}
/>
```

<OpenApiResponse
  definitionId="petstore"
  pointer="#/components/responses/PetResponse"
  hideSamples={true}
/>

## Other components

What other components would you like to see? Let us know. We're adding new components.

## Developing new components

A developer familiar with React can create new components.
We left a sample component at `/components/Counter.tsx`.
Inspect it and its usage at `/developer-portal/custom-component.mdx`.
