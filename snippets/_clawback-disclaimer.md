{% admonition type="info" name="Attention" %}

_Clawback functionality is part of the proposed [XLS-39d-clawback](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-39d-clawback) extension to the XRP Ledger protocol. You can use these functions on the Devnet test network, but there isn't an official amendment and they aren't available on the production Mainnet. Until there is an amendment, the details documented on these pages are subject to change._ <!-- SPELLING_IGNORE: 39d -->
